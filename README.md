9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

   Steps to Set Up and Start Debugging a Simple Program

Open or Create a Project:
Open VS Code and either create a new project or open an existing one.
Ensure your project contains the necessary code files for the program you want to debug.

Install Required Extensions:
Depending on the language you're using, install the necessary extensions. For example, for Python, you need the Python extension by Microsoft; for JavaScript, the Node.js extension.

Create a Launch Configuration:
Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and type Debug: Open launch.json.
If there is no launch configuration file (launch.json), VS Code will prompt you to create one. Choose the appropriate environment (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.).
VS Code will create a launch.json file in a .vscode folder in your workspace.

Configure launch.json:
The launch.json file will contain configurations for debugging. Adjust the settings according to your project's requirements.
Modify the "program" path to point to the entry file of your application.

Set Breakpoints:
Open the file you want to debug and set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter to the left of the line numbers or by pressing F9 when the cursor is on a line of code.

Start Debugging:
Press F5 or go to the Debug view by clicking the Debug icon in the Activity Bar and click the green play button.
Your program will start, and execution will pause at any breakpoints you've set.

Debugging Features in VS Code

Breakpoints:
Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines of code.
Conditional breakpoints and logpoints are also supported, allowing more control over where and when the execution pauses.

Watch Expressions:
Add expressions to the Watch panel to monitor their values over time as you step through your code.

Call Stack:
View the call stack to see the function calls that led to the current point in execution.
Navigate through the call stack to examine different levels of the function call hierarchy.

Variables Pane:
Inspect variables in the current scope, including local, global, and closure variables.
Expand complex objects to explore their properties and values.

Step Controls:
Use the step controls to navigate through your code:
Continue (F5): Resume execution until the next breakpoint.
Step Over (F10): Execute the next line of code, but step over function calls.
Step Into (F11): Step into function calls to debug inside the function.
Step Out (Shift+F11): Step out of the current function and return to the caller.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

    Initializing a Git Repository
Open Your Project:

Open the project folder you want to version control in VS Code.
Initialize Git:

Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or press Ctrl+Shift+G).
Click the Initialize Repository button.
This creates a .git directory in your project folder, initializing it as a Git repository.
2. Making Commits
Stage Changes:

In the Source Control view, you’ll see a list of changes under Changes.
Click the + icon next to the file or the + icon at the top to stage all changes. Staged changes will move to the Staged Changes section.
Commit Changes:

Enter a commit message in the text box above the Changes and Staged Changes sections.
Click the ✓ icon (or press Ctrl+Enter) to commit the staged changes.
Your changes are now committed locally.
3. Pushing Changes to GitHub
Set Up Remote Repository:

If you don’t have a remote repository yet, create one on GitHub.
Copy the repository URL from GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/username/repo.git).
Add Remote Repository:

Open the Terminal in VS Code by going to View > Terminal (or press `Ctrl+``).
Add the remote repository by running:

Push Changes:

Push your commits to the remote repository by running:

Key Git Features in VS Code
Branch Management:

Switch branches, create new branches, and manage branches using the branch icon in the bottom-left corner or through the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P > Git: Create Branch).
Pull and Fetch:

Use the Source Control view or the Command Palette to pull or fetch changes from the remote repository.
Merge Conflicts:

VS Code provides a visual editor for resolving merge conflicts, highlighting conflicting changes and offering options to accept or reject changes.
Viewing Commit History:

Use extensions like GitLens to view detailed commit history, blame annotations, and more.
File History and Blame:

Right-click on a file and choose Open File History or Open Blame to see the commit history or the last change made to each line.
